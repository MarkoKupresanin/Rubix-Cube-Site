  <div class="flex-child1">
    <i>The beginner method used in this video is seen in many other YouTube tutorials and this video in particular by <strong> Jperm </strong> is also very easy to grasp by beginners.</i>
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-child2">
     You first start out in this video by finding the white center piece on your cube, and then finding the pieces with two colors on them that have a white color. These were then used to match up with the white center.
  </div>

  <div class="flex-child3">
  	Next you find the 4 corner piece that have white on them, and use a short algorithm <strong>(R, U, R', U')</strong> to put them in their respective spots based on their color. 
  </div>

  <div class="flex-child4">
  	Now at the halfway point in your solve, you look for 4 edge pieces (they have only two colors on them) and you bring that piece so it matches up with one of the center colors and that edge color in the top layer. Next you move the top layer only to make the edge piece on the oposite side of its color <i> It will either go left or right</i>. Then you will take out the corner under where it goes using the algorithm previously used and then use the other hand (ex: removed corner with right hand algorithm, use left hand to put back both pieces). You will continue to do this until the first two layers are solved. 
  </div>

  <div class="flex-child5">
  	After this we want to make a yellow cross on the top like we did with the white. There are multiple cases in this but all are handled the same. You will want to hold the cube with yellow facing up and white down. Next you will do this algorithm: F, R, U, R', U', F'. You will do this until a yellow cross appears on top. 
  </div>



  <div class="flex-child6">
  	Next we will make all the yellow edges aligned propely. It's as simple as doing just one algorithm. R, U, R', U, R, U2, R'. Now all the edges should be solved, if not do it again. (Hint: you may need to move the top layer around). 
  </div>


  <div class="flex-child7">
  	Now for putting the corners in the correct spot. You will have to check if any of the colors match up, they dont have to be actually solved but just flipped is perfectly fine. If you have all 4 or none solved then you do this algorithm from anywhere, but if you have 1 solved, hold it on the top right. Now do this algorithm: U, R, U', L, U, R', U', L'. Now you check how many are in the correct spots. If all of them are great! You can move on to the next step. But if not you will want to re-do the algorithm until all 4 are in the correct spot (They do not need to be facing the right way).
  </div>


  <div class="flex-child8">
  	Now for the last step. You will hold the cube with the white side up and yellow down. To finish off hold an unsolved corner on the bottom right. And use the algorithm from the white corners until yellow is facing down. If you have more than one yellow corner to do this to, then do it by moving ONLY the bottom layer into that bottom right spot. Now you're done!
